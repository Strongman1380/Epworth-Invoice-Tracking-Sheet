# data-flow-service-tracking

The data flow service tracking system integrates clinical documentation and service monitoring across four key areas:

1. Clinical Documentation Flow
- `src/api/parseCaseNote.js` handles structured case note parsing and validation
- Enforces third-person clinical voice standards
- Validates service type categorization (OHFS/IHFS, PTSV, DST-U, DST-MS, DST-SP, DST-HF)
- Routes documentation through appropriate clinical review workflows

2. Authorization Status Monitoring
- `src/api/checkAuthAlerts.js` manages service authorization tracking
- Monitors expiration windows for family support services
- Routes authorization alerts through appropriate clinical supervisory channels
- Tracks service-specific authorization requirements

3. Clinical Reporting Pipeline
- `src/api/generateExecutiveReport.js` structures trauma-informed reporting flows
- Routes service delivery metrics through appropriate assessment channels
- Integrates safety assessments with goal progress tracking
- Channels clinical recommendations through supervisory review

4. Progress Monitoring System
- `src/api/generateMonthlySummary.js` coordinates monthly clinical assessments
- Routes therapeutic goal progress through standardized evaluation channels
- Integrates family engagement metrics with barrier assessments
- Channels progress data through clinical recommendation workflows

The system maintains HIPAA-compliant data routing while ensuring clinical documentation standards and safety protocols are preserved throughout all data flows.
