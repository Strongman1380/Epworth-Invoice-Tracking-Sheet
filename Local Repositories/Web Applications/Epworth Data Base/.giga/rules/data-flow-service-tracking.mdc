description: Defines service tracking data flows between components for family services case management and monitoring

# data-flow-service-tracking

Primary data flows handle service tracking across three key dimensions:

1. Authorization Flow (Importance: 90/100)
`api/checkAuthAlerts.js`
- Monitors service authorization periods across case types
- Aggregates expiration alerts through case directory
- Routes authorization status updates to case management components
- Integrates with lookback window system for expiration prediction

2. Case Documentation Flow (Importance: 95/100)
`api/parseCaseNote.js`
- Structures service interaction data through trauma-informed parsing
- Routes extracted service types and contact methods 
- Streams goal tracking metrics to progress assessment engine
- Enforces professional documentation standards in data pipeline

3. Progress Monitoring Flow (Importance: 95/100) 
`api/generateMonthlySummary.js`
- Aggregates multi-dimensional progress data across family units
- Routes goal achievement metrics through specialized reporting sections
- Streams safety assessment data to summary generation
- Integrates professional voice transformation in documentation flow

Core Integration Points:
- Service authorization status feeds into case documentation
- Case notes drive progress monitoring metrics
- Progress data influences authorization tracking
- All flows enforce trauma-informed data handling
- Professional documentation standards applied across flows
