# service-authorization-workflow

Authorization tracking system for family support services with expiration monitoring and alert generation.

## Core Authorization Components

1. Expiration Tracking (src/api/checkAuthAlerts.js)
- Monitors service authorization periods for family services
- Calculates expiration windows based on service type:
  - OHFS/IHFS: 90-day authorization periods
  - PTSV: 180-day authorization periods
  - DST variants: Service-specific durations
- Generates tiered alerts at 30, 15, and 7 days before expiration

2. Service Type Validation
- Enforces specific service type authorization rules:
  - DST-U (Diagnostic Support Team - Urgent)
  - DST-MS (Diagnostic Support Team - Medical Specialty)
  - DST-SP (Diagnostic Support Team - Specialized)
  - DST-HF (Diagnostic Support Team - High Functioning)

3. Authorization Status Monitoring
- Tracks active vs. expired authorizations
- Maintains authorization history per client
- Links authorizations to clinical documentation requirements
- Integrates with monthly progress reporting workflows

## Business Rules

1. Authorization Windows
- Standard services: 90-day default period
- Specialized services: Custom authorization periods
- Emergency services: 14-day rapid authorization
- Extensions require clinical justification

2. Alert Generation
- Approaching expiration notifications
- Expired authorization warnings
- Renewal requirement reminders
- Clinical documentation linkages
