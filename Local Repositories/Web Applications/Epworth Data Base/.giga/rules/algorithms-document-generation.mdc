Path: `api/parseCaseNote.js`, `api/generateMonthlySummary.js`

### Case Note Generation
- Domain-specific parsing rules for family service documentation
- Enforces professional standards through language transformation
- Structured content extraction:
  - Service type classification
  - Contact method categorization
  - Family interaction patterns
- Trauma-informed language validation and correction
- Goal tracking markers and progress indicators

### Monthly Summary Compilation
- Specialized report sections:
  - Goals progress assessment
  - Barrier identification
  - Safety status evaluation
- Professional voice transformation rules for Family Life Specialists
- Multi-dimensional progress tracking across family units
- Integration of trauma-informed documentation requirements

## Document Standards Enforcement (Importance: 90/100)
- Professional documentation standards verification
- Trauma-informed language pattern matching
- Service-specific terminology requirements
- Family-centric documentation structure
- Progress assessment terminology standardization
- Safety-focused language protocols
- Goal-oriented documentation markers

## Document Integration Patterns
- Family unit relationship documentation
- Service authorization period inclusion
- Goal tracking integration
- Safety assessment incorporation
- Professional voice consistency
- Multi-party interaction documentation
- Progress monitoring markers
