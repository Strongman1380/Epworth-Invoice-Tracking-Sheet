# algorithms-document-generation

The document generation system implements specialized algorithms for clinical documentation in family services:

## Case Note Processing Algorithm
Location: src/api/parseCaseNote.js

- Enforces professional third-person voice through language pattern matching
- Validates and structures service types (OHFS/IHFS, PTSV, DST-U, DST-MS, DST-SP, DST-HF)
- Transforms raw case notes into standardized clinical format
- Applies trauma-informed language filters

## Monthly Summary Generation
Location: src/api/generateMonthlySummary.js

Structured assessment algorithm that compiles:
- Progress toward therapeutic goals
- Safety assessment metrics
- Barrier identification patterns
- Family engagement scoring
- Clinical recommendations synthesis

## Executive Report Generation
Location: src/api/generateExecutiveReport.js

Clinical supervision report creation with:
- Service delivery metrics aggregation
- Safety assessment compilation
- Goal progress tracking synthesis
- Authorization status monitoring
- Clinical recommendations formatting

The document generation system enforces:
1. HIPAA-compliant content structuring
2. Clinical documentation standards
3. Professional voice requirements
4. Trauma-informed language patterns
5. Industry-standard reporting sections

Importance Score: 75/100
- Critical for clinical documentation compliance
- Core business requirement for family services
- Specialized domain-specific implementation
