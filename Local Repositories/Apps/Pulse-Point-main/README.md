# Welcome to your Lovable project

## 🔒 HIPAA Compliance & Security

This application includes comprehensive HIPAA-compliant features for healthcare providers:

- **User-Level Data Isolation**: Each provider's client data is completely segregated
- **Row-Level Security**: Database-enforced access controls prevent unauthorized data access
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Unique constraints prevent client data mixing and HIPAA violations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

📋 For detailed information, see:
- [HIPAA_COMPLIANCE.md](./HIPAA_COMPLIANCE.md) - Complete compliance documentation
- [TESTING_CLIENT_UNIQUENESS.md](./TESTING_CLIENT_UNIQUENESS.md) - Testing guide for duplicate detection
